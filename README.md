# React Hooks Talk - CH1: useState & useReducer


This project was generated with the `npm init code-surfer-deck` command.

## Development

To run the presentation deck in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Edit the [`deck.mdx`](deck.mdx) file to get started.

We get inspired by Da [Dan's hook demo](https://react-conf-2018-hooks-intro.netlify.app/) from react conf

## Exporting

To build the presentation deck:

```sh
npm run build
```
